## Abstract

Understand how to develop an efficient MLOps Pipeline by separating and concatenating ML/DL workloads into components based on Kubeflow kfp compiler, converting them into pipelines, and uploading them on GCP Vertex AI to understand the template structure.

Kubeflow kfp compiler를 기반으로 ML/DL 워크로드를 Component로 분리 및 연결하여 Pipeline으로 변환 후, GCP Vertex AI 상에 업로드해보면서 효율적인 MLOps Pipeline 개발 방식을 이해 및 template 구조.

## Installation
### Dev Environment
Anaconda environment
```bash
conda create -n [env name] python=3.10
```
Install requirements
```bash
bash ./requirements-bash.sh
```
### Hands-On Compile
```bash
python kfp-hands-on.py
```

## Usage
### Make Workflow

### Construct Pipeline with Components

### Compile Pipeline Code

### Upload to Platform MLOps Pipeline Service (GCP Vertex AI, On-premise Kubeflow, AWS Sagemaker)

### Debug Error for Components
